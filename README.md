## Requirements

The project was bootstrapped with [create-react-app for TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter).
So you need Node.js and npm or yarn.

Then you can install all the dependencies:

```sh
$ npm i
```

or

```sh
$ yarn
```

respectively. I'm using yarn, so I'll be writing commands for yarn.
You can convert them to npm commands easily using the
[cheatsheet](https://shift.infinite.red/npm-vs-yarn-cheat-sheet-8755b092e5cc).


## Running the project

To run the project, just type

```sh
$ yarn start
```

## Running tests

To run the unit tests, just use the command

```sh
$ yarn test
```

If you want to see the coverage, run it with `--` and ``--coverage` flag:

```sh
$ yarn test -- --coverage
```
